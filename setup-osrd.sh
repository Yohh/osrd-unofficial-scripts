  You add can some arguments to the script:
  - ${LIGHTCYAN}dev-front${NC} to launch the front-end in development mode (will be saved in .osrd-compose-state)
  - ${LIGHTCYAN}sw${NC} to enable single worker mode (will be saved in .osrd-compose-state)
  - ${LIGHTCYAN}host${NC} to use networking mode (will be saved in .osrd-compose-state)
  - ${LIGHTCYAN}default${NC} to launch the base configuration and clear the saved state
- Restoring the ${LIGHTCYAN}backup${NC}, which will stop the containers, restore the backup, then relaunch the containers.
- Doing ${LIGHTCYAN}both${NC}, which will reset the docker configuration, then restore the backup.
